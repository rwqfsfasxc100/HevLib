# HevLib
Library mod for ΔV: Rings of Saturn that provides several useful functions.

This library is run through a set of 'pointers', which are small snippets of code that act, like the namesake, as pointers towards each function's file and as a way to organize a larger number of features into an easy to access location.

# Usage
> [!WARNING]
> Do note that this library is comprised of several ModMain.gd files. If you plan on writing mods which makes use of functions provided by this library, and some features do not work properly in the Godot editor, you will need to load all (at the time of writing) 4 of the library's ModMain files, which are as follows:
> ```
> "res://HevLib/ModMain.gd",
> "res://HevLib/scenes/keymapping/ModMain.gd",
> "res://HevLib/scenes/equipment/ModMain.gd",
> "res://HevLib/webtranslate/ModMain.gd",
> ```
