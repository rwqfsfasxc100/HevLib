# HevLib
Library mod for Î”V: Rings of Saturn that provides several useful functions

# Usage
## Instancing within a script
Each script requires the library to be loaded as a variant to be able to access the functions. The following script will have it loaded as a variant:
```
var HevLib = preload("res://HevLib/Functions.gd").new()
```
> [!NOTE]
> The variant can be called anywhere in a function, however to get access to it in the entire file, it's recommended to put it just below the extends statement

Once loaded into a function, it can be called by calling the variant's functions, with the syntax of `HevLib.__example_function`

Example script using the __array_to_string function from the library:
```
extends Node

var HevLib = preload("res://HevLib/Functions.gd").new()

func _ready():
  var array = ["this ", "is ", "an ", "example"]
  var string = HevLib.__array_to_string(array)
  return string
```
The script returns "this is an example" as a string

## Functions

> [!NOTE]
> All functions in the library use a double underscore prefix to make it easier to use with autocomplete. Typing `HevLib.__` should provide all available functions through it.

## __array_to_string(arr: Array) -> String
* Concatenates all parts of an array into a string
* Returns a string in the form of array[0] + array[1] + ... + array[n] etc.
 
## __get_zip_content(path: String, Strip_Parent_Folder: bool = false, To_Lower_Case: bool = false) -> Array
* Lists all files in the zip by paths relative to the mod's name folder
* i.e. a zip only containing a folder and a text file return [folder/, file.txt]
* Returns an array of file paths in zip-relative form, stored alphabetically
* Strip_Parent_Folder removes the first folder item before the slash.
* To_Lower_Case converts all characters to lower


## __fetch_file_from_zip(path: String, Destination_Folder_Path: String, Desired_File_Paths: Array) -> Array
* Loads a zip file and stores the requested files from paths relative to the root
* If you intend on taking data from a zip multiple times, this is a preferable method as it loads it to disk for future reference instead
* Does not work for fetching compressed data from within a zip (images, archives, .stex streams, etc)
* Defer to external programs for full unzip control
* Generates all folders in the zip file before handling the files to ensure they can save properly, but may cause clutter
* Outputs an array of all files saved to disk
* Handles case insensitivities

## __load_manifest_from_file(manifest: String) -> Dictionary
* Loads manifest data and returns it as a dictionary

## __load_file(modDir: String, zipDir: String, hasManifest: bool, manifestDirectory: String, hasIcon: bool, iconDir: String) -> String
* Specific function for Mod Menu behaviour
* modDir is the mod main's directory (form of res://Mod_Folder/ModMain.gd)
* zipDor is the directory of the mod's zip (form of mod_folder/mod.zip)
* hasManifest determines whether the manifest should be used
* manifestDirectory is the directory of the mod.manifest file (form of res://Mod_Folder/mod.manifest)
* hasIcon determines whether the custom mod icon should be used
* iconDir is the directory of the icon.stex file (form of res://Mod_Folder/icon.stex

## __get_mod_main(file: String, split_into_array: bool = false) -> String
* Returns 16 lines of text, split by a newline (\n), of mod data in a single string using the mod menu data standard
* Optional split_into_array bool converts the data into an array preemptively
* Preferable use of fetching mod data as it combines several of the previous helper functions into one, and removes the need for overhead code

## __check_folder_exists(folder: String) -> bool
* Ensures the supplied folder exists
* If folder exists, returns true
* Otherwise, attempts to create it. If it succeeds, returns true, else returns false

## __fetch_folder_files(folder: String, showFolders: bool = false, returnFullPath: bool = false) -> Array
* Returns the files in the supplied folder
* If showFolders is set to true, includes folders with the output

## __get_file_content(file: String) -> String
* Returns the content from a file as a string

## __get_first_file(folder: String) -> String
* Supplies the first file in a folder
* If no files exists, returns false

## __recursive_delete(path: String)
* Recursively deletes the provided folder
* Returns false if the folder doesn't load

## __format_for_large_numbers(num: int) -> String:
* Formats numbers into a human-readable form, separated with a comma

## __webtranslate(URL: String):
* Loads translations from a given Gihub repository
* Has to be specifically a repository link
* E.G. https://github.com/rwqfsfasxc100/HevLib

## __webtranslate_reset(URL: String) -> bool
* Clears the translation cache of a provided URL
* Returns true if succeeded, false if it didn't
