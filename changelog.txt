5.1="* Currently only adds __get_drivers, which returns an array of mods and their drivers, ordered by mod priority."
5.2="* Optional argument of get_ids for an array of mod IDs to specifically fetch, otherwise lists all mods regardless of manifest if blank. Defaults to []"
6="* Added REPLACE_TRANSLATIONS.gd driver."
6.1="* Used to register translations intended to replace translation strings existing within vanilla or other mods."
6.2="* Will still accept and register new translation strings regardless of it existing prior to runtime."
6.3="* Formatted to translation dictionary standards, using a singular constant const TRANSLATIONS = {}"

1="* Fixed issues with certain Mod Menu 2 buttons being inaccessible with a keyboard or controller. They should now have the intended buttons set as the focus for directional buttons."
2="* Reduced the spaghetti code that is Mod Menu 2's restart after update system. The restart button should now restart the game properly this time around."
3="* Fixed missing background for the clear Steam leaderboards menu, which should no longer be completely transparent."
4="* For developers: Removed test button clutter, as I've deferred these to my own private test mod, so launching through Godot should be a little closer to release builds."
5="* Rearranged load order for some specific interactions that prevented vanilla translation strings from being overridden"
6="* Minerals added through ADD_MINERALS.gd now no longer let you sell or trade a mineral if the price is set to 0.0."

2="* Fixed Ukranian translations not being loaded"

[1.10.11]

1="* When modifying properties of a node with NODE_DEFINITIONS.gd or SHIP_NODE_REGISTER.gd, you are now able to use an array of dictionaries instead of a dictionary. The string used to define the property, and if on a child node, node path is set with the property entry, given there is no longer a key that defines the data."
2="* Modifying properties of a node with NODE_DEFINITIONS.gd or SHIP_NODE_REGISTER.gd can now be defered to the next idle frame by adding a "defer":true entry. This is false by default"

[1.10.10]

[1.9.13]

1="* Changed the way that slots can be added or removed from specific vessels through the use of a new prevent_ships array, replacing the invert_limit_logic boolean."
2="* Using ShipModificationDriver, you can now add ammunition, nanodrones, propellant or mass based on the amount currently added to the ship. consumables (mass driver ammo, nanodrone components and propellant) will take into account other sources of additional consumable into the percentage, while mass takes only the base ship mass into account"
3="* ShipModificationDriver can now be used to add EMP shielding to a ship."
4="* Nanodrones, like mass driver ammo, are now limited to the output of the nanodrone storage. This will rarely ever be reached, even with modded drone mounts (like those from NTCED), so likely will never be an actual issue, however you can still turn this off if so desired."
5="* Added toggle to disable the current players text on Steam clients"
6="* Added modified ConversationPlayer script to allow events to be spawned alongside dialogue, however this is purely to be used in custom dialogue scenes as no dialogue helper scripts are planned for anytime soon unless desired by other modders"
7="* Added optional parent_node_path property for nodes being added to ships via SHIP_NODE_REGISTER.gd. This allows you to specify a path to a node to act as the added node's parent. If the path is invalid or not provided, resorts to default behaviour of having the ship node act as the parent."

[1.9.8]

1="* Fixed crash caused by returning to Enceladus in release builds"
2="* Adjusted how ManifestV2.__match_mod_path_to_zip functions, it's data is now fetched and cached during the start of the onready phase, which this function is now used to fetch and find the provided mod's result from the cache."
3="* Pointer-based functions will now no longer spam the engine logs when using --verbose"
4="* Reworked WeaponSlotDriver to fix hardpoint equipment not installing correctly on some vessels"

[1.9.7]

1="* Fixed mass not working for MODIFY_INTERNALS.gd"
2="* Added 3 new options for MODIFY_INTERNALS.gd:"
2.1="* mass_per_crew - increases the mass of the equipment for every crew slot that the ship can fit. This dynamically changes when modifying crew numbers"
2.2="* mass_per_processed_tonne - adds mass based on how much processed capacity the ship has, at a ratio of x kg per tonne of processed storage capacity. Will take into account amorphic holds, and multiply by 6 accordingly"
2.3="* mass_per_tonne_total_storage_added - adds mass based on how much storage is added by the equipment, based on the values of storage_flat, storage_ammo, storage_nanodrones, storage_propellant, storage_multi_upper, and storage_multi_lower at a ratio of x kg per tonne of storage added. This also works conversely, where any decrease in storage will also decrease mass."
3="* Allowed more values to allow negative integer or float inputs to remove storage or capacity, as well as more checks to ensure a resulting property won't end up negative where it would normally result in a crash otherwise."

[1.9.6]

1="* The astrogation marker colour selector now shrinks down and allows you to scroll when another mod adds new mineral types."
2="* The geologist menu toggles now has a scrollbar when the number of minerals added would cause the display to vanish past the edge of the panel."
3="* Changed the way aux units are fitted to ships via AuxPowerDriver. This should stop random occurrences where a ship would fly out without a modded aux unit installed, if one were applied in the equipment menu."
4="* ManifestV2.2 inputs now accept joy buttons and sticks. Do note that there is no current visual for axis direction due to it using vanilla icons, however the displayed sign in the button select window will display it."
5="* Input type config options now can be reset to default from menus"
6="* Added 4 new input options for handling geologist menu scrolling, one for each horizontal direction and joystick on a standard controller"
