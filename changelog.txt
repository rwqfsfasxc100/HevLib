4.4="* percent - float used as a percentage of the file downloaded. Equivalent to (bytes_downloaded / total_bytes ) * 100.0. If HEVLIB_GITHUB_PROGRESS_DOWNLOADING_ONLY_BYTES is the response string, do not trust this value due to it being sent whenever total_bytes is less than zero."
4.5="* bytes_downloaded - total byte count of downloaded data."
4.6="* total_bytes - the downloading file's total size in bytes. If HEVLIB_GITHUB_PROGRESS_DOWNLOADING_ONLY_BYTES is the response string, likely was returned -1"

[1.10.9]

3="* ShipModificationDriver can now be used to add EMP shielding to a ship."
4="* Nanodrones, like mass driver ammo, are now limited to the output of the nanodrone storage. This will rarely ever be reached, even with modded drone mounts (like those from NTCED), so likely will never be an actual issue, however you can still turn this off if so desired."
5="* Added toggle to disable the current players text on Steam clients"
6="* Added modified ConversationPlayer script to allow events to be spawned alongside dialogue, however this is purely to be used in custom dialogue scenes as no dialogue helper scripts are planned for anytime soon unless desired by other modders"

4="* Reworked WeaponSlotDriver to fix hardpoint equipment not installing correctly on some vessels"

[1.9.7]

1="* Fixed mass not working for MODIFY_INTERNALS.gd"
2="* Added 3 new options for MODIFY_INTERNALS.gd:"
2.1="* mass_per_crew - increases the mass of the equipment for every crew slot that the ship can fit. This dynamically changes when modifying crew numbers"
2.2="* mass_per_processed_tonne - adds mass based on how much processed capacity the ship has, at a ratio of x kg per tonne of processed storage capacity. Will take into account amorphic holds, and multiply by 6 accordingly"

This also works conversely, where any decrease in storage will also decrease mass."
3="* Allowed more values to allow negative integer or float inputs to remove storage or capacity, as well as more checks to ensure a resulting property won't end up negative where it would normally result in a crash otherwise."

[1.9.6]

4="* ManifestV2.2 inputs now accept joy buttons and sticks. Do note that there is no current visual for axis direction due to it using vanilla icons, however the displayed sign in the button select window will display it."
