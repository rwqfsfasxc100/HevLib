RESEARCH IDEA CENTER

Allow research to appear after a set amount of time, randomly, or dissapear for specified/unspecified time
unlimited researches, or 1-n allowed at one time.
Set initial research cost. will have to pay again if cancelled / limit reduced
Use multiple story tags to define different tasks and allow variable finishing lengths. e.g. 6 conversations with miners, 2 payments of 100k each, wait a total of 10 days
Progress bar uses custom tooltip to define sections

Research points (RP?), collected idly or can be purchased for larger amounts of cash could be used to advance research tasks
Gained naturally through flying in the rings, when not docked and above 5 m/s. Linear acceleration also plays a part, providing a marginal multiplier between 0.75 and 1.25 times depending on how much you've accelerated in the last minute?
Same methods used to provide crew experience and/or education could be used for additional incentives for non-afk play.

MODES

`story_only` uses just the `story_flag` value to define when to unlock, and must define a value to set which marks the equipment's unlock point
`story_progress` uses the `story_flag` value to define progress, but unlocking the equipment is set with a different story flag. This can be useful to ensure that changes made to the project don't affect the unlocked equipment
`isolated` defines that the advanced research setup is used.
